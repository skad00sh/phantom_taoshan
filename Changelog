1- Intelli-plug 2.0
2- Overclocked up to 1.5 Ghz.
3- PS3 Controller Support.
4- Simple I/O Scheduler.
5- Tweaked VM Readahead to 2048 kb.
6- Voltage Control.

v6:
Introducing newer Intelli-plug in kernel. 
OC up to 1.5Ghz
Userspace voltage control.
Newer Eco mode.
Dynamic Fsync 2.0.
Added ARM optimization flags while compiling.
Lock initial TCP window size to 64k (Improves network ping and output)
Asynchronous I/O latency to a solid-state disk greatly increased
Added optimized AES and SHA1 routines.
Optimized apply_slack() method for size and speed
Entropy tweaks.
Patches from mainline 3.5 to hopefully help with hotplug efficiency.
Added touch boost support for taoshan touchpad driver in Intelli-plug.
Dynamic management of dirty page writebacks
Salvaged some RAM.
Disabled unwinding support.

..and some more patches and tweaks which I probably forgot to mention.
