v2:
Updated to 4.2.2.

v3:
Fixed WiFi.

v4:
Major update.
1- Intelli-plug 2.0
2- Overclocked up to 1.5 Ghz.
3- PS3 Controller Support.
4- Simple I/O Scheduler.
5- Tweaked VM Readahead to 2048 kb.
6- Voltage Control.
7- Force 500Ma charging on unknown wall chargers and car chargers.
8- Disabled Gentle Fair Sleeps and enabled ARCH_POWER.
9- Added Wheatley Governer.
10- O3 Compiler optimizations.
11- Compiled using NEON compiler optimizations.

v5:
Initial KitKat support.
Check OP for list of features on KitKat kernel, Jellybean kernel is still limited to v4.5

v6:
Introducing newer Intelli-plug in kernel. 
OC up to 1.5Ghz
Userspace voltage control.
Newer Eco mode.
Dynamic Fsync 2.0.
Added ARM optimization flags while compiling.
Lock initial TCP window size to 64k (Improves network ping and output)
Asynchronous I/O latency to a solid-state disk greatly increased
Added optimized AES and SHA1 routines.
Optimized apply_slack() method for size and speed
Entropy tweaks.
Patches from mainline 3.5 to hopefully help with hotplug efficiency.
Added touch boost support for taoshan touchpad driver in Intelli-plug.
Dynamic management of dirty page writebacks
Salvaged some RAM.
Disabled unwinding support.

..and some more patches and tweaks which I probably forgot to mention.


v6.1:
KitKat:
Switched to TWRP 2.6.3.0 instead of very very old CWM.

Jellybean:
Two versions of kernel: OC and NON-OC, just like KitKat kernel. 
Switched to TWRP 2.6.3.0 instead of very very old CWM.
Introducing newer Intelli-plug in kernel. 
Added more ARM optimization flags.
Lock initial TCP window size to 64k (Improves network ping and output).
Asynchronous I/O latency to a solid-state disk greatly increased.
Added optimized AES and SHA1 routines.

Salvaged some RAM.
Disabled unwinding support.
Removed Simple I/O Scheduler.
Removed Wheatley governer.

v6.2:
KitKat:
Enabled SELINUX at kernel for better compatibility with KitKat, flashing zips of KitKat ROMs wasn't possible without this in recovery.

Jellybean:
No changes.

v7:
Merged Internal storage fix by @siankatabg	into the KitKat kernel. I'll post extra work to be done by user too.
Switched to auto hot plug from intelli-plug. Reason is that when I updated intelli-plug as per latest updates by faux123 and added his special dual core intelli-plug, device started lagging like hell. If anybody can help me out with fixing dual core intelli-plug, feel free to send a pull request on github.
Switched to latest Linaro GCC 4.7.4 with optimization for cortex A15 CPUs. You'll notice the bump in smoothness. 
Added more flags for cortex A15 while compiling. Smooooth.
Added CPU OC up to 1.7 Ghz.
Complete SELinux integration, now you can change mode between permissive and enforcing too. 
Fixed over ride of frequency of second core completely(I need feedback on this).
Introducing Intelli-thermal in kernel which is a better and smoother alternative to stock thermal controller, I have turned off stock thermal monitor completely. 
Added latest intelli-active governer with touch boost support for taoshan touchpad driver.
Introducing Charger Control found in Thunderzap kernel. Thanks to @varun.chitre15
Fixed date and time stamps in recovery.
Asynchronous fsync: Initial extraction from HTC.
Enabled Westwood TCP Congession.
Enabled Sony PS3 controller support back.
Changed boot splash logo to a more funky and cooler Phantom kernel one.
Updated TWRP to v2.7.
